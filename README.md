# HttpClientService
A very simple abstraction of the HttpClient intended as a code sample/demo.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this library is to demonstrate some of the abstractions I try to build into my code. It shows basic competence around use of HTTP and generics in C#. I also demo a number of unit tests and testing tools developed to test HTTP requests.

You probably don't want to use this library! Check out [flurl.dev](https://flurl.dev/) instead, which uses builder pattern extensions on strings. The only advantage of this library over flurl is the ability to create mocks of the classes for testing, but flurl also provides testing methods.
